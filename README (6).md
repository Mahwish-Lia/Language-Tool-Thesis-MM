## 🌍 Real-World TVET Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Construction Training with AI 🏗️

<div class="scenario-card">

**Smart Building Technology Training**

**Maria**, an instructor at a construction training institute, faces the challenge of integrating AI-powered building design software into her curriculum. The new tools can optimize material usage and predict structural issues, but she must ensure students understand both the technology and the ethical implications of automated decision-making in construction safety.

**🤔 Key Question:** How should Maria balance teaching technical AI skills while maintaining focus on safety ethics and professional responsibility?

</div>

                          --{{1}}--
In this scenario, Maria represents thousands of TVET instructors who must adapt their teaching to include AI tools while maintaining the fundamental principles of their trades. Construction safety cannot be compromised, even as AI enhances efficiency.

### Scenario 2: Healthcare Training Revolution 🏥

<div class="scenario-card">

**AI-Assisted Diagnostics in Nursing Education**

**Dr. Ahmed**, a nursing instructor, is implementing AI diagnostic assistance tools in his clinical training program. While these tools can help student nurses identify patterns in patient data more quickly, he must ensure they develop critical thinking skills and understand when to question AI recommendations.

**🤔 Key Question:** How can Dr. Ahmed ensure his students become competent healthcare professionals who use AI as a tool rather than a replacement for clinical judgment?

</div>

                          --{{2}}--
Healthcare education presents unique challenges with AI integration. The stakes are incredibly high, and the need for ethical, quality-focused training is paramount to patient safety and care excellence.

## 🧠 Interactive Quiz Section 1: Understanding Role Changes

<div class="quiz-container">

### 🎯 Knowledge Check 1: Evolving Teacher Roles

How are teachers' roles fundamentally changing in the AI era?

</div>

**Question 1: Primary Role Shift**

What represents the most significant shift in teacher roles with AI integration?

    [( )] Becoming technology specialists exclusively
    [(X)] Evolving from information deliverers to learning facilitators
    [( )] Replacing human judgment with AI decisions
    [( )] Focusing only on traditional teaching methods
    [[?]] Consider how AI changes the teacher-student dynamic

<script>
if (@input === 2) {
  send.liascript(`
<div class="success-message">
✅ **Perfect!** Teachers are indeed shifting from being primary information sources to becoming facilitators who help students navigate, evaluate, and learn alongside AI tools. This represents a fundamental pedagogical transformation.
</div>
  `);
} else {
  send.liascript(`
<div class="warning-message">
❌ **Not quite right.** While technology skills are important, the most significant change is the shift from information delivery to learning facilitation. Teachers guide students in using AI as a collaborative learning tool while developing critical thinking skills.
</div>
  `);
}
</script>

**Question 2: Essential New Skills**

Which skills are becoming essential for teachers in the AI era? (Select all that apply)

    [[ ]] Ethical AI decision-making
    [[ ]] AI tool evaluation and selection
    [[ ]] Traditional lecturing techniques only
    [[ ]] Student-AI collaboration facilitation
    [[?]] Think about both technical and ethical competencies

               selected.every(i => correct.includes(i));

if (isCorrect) {
  send.liascript(`
<div class="success-message">
✅ **Excellent!** You've identified the key competencies: ethical AI decision-making, AI tool evaluation, and facilitating student-AI collaboration. Traditional lecturing alone is insufficient in the AI era - teachers need these new integrated skills.
</div>
  `);
} else {
  send.liascript(`
<div class="warning-message">
❌ **Partial credit.** The essential skills include ethical AI decision-making, AI tool evaluation and selection, and facilitating student-AI collaboration. Traditional teaching methods remain valuable but must be integrated with AI competencies, not used exclusively.
</div>
  `);
